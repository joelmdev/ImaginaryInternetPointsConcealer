# ImaginaryInternetPointsConcealer

## What?
Greasemonkey script that hides rep changes on StackExchange sites during normal business hours. Get back to work.
## Why?
Because some of us are attracted to shiny things and we need a little help staying focused. If you're researching an issue and you land on a StackExchange site, you don't need to be distracted by your recent increase (or decrease) in imaginary internet points.
